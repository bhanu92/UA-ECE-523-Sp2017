	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new feature selection method
using a mutual information-based criterion that measures the
importance of a feature in a backward selection framework. It
considers the dependency among many features and uses either
one of two well-known probability density function estimation
methods when computing the criterion. The proposed approach
is compared with existing mutual information-based methods and
another sophisticated filter method on many artificial and realworld
problems. The numerical results show that the proposed
method can effectively identify the important features in data
sets having dependency among many features and is superior, in
almost all cases, to the benchmark methods.},

@book{Ashrafi2007,
	Abstract = {As in all living organisms, survival in C. elegans requires adequate
	management of energy supplies. Genetic screens have revealed that
	C. elegans fat regulation involves a complex network of genes with
	known or likely functions in food sensation, neuroendocrine signaling,
	uptake, transport, storage and utilization of fats. Core fat and
	sugar metabolic pathways are conserved in C. elegans. Flux through
	these pathways is modulated by cellular energy sensors that operate
	via transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms. In turn,
	neuroendocrine mechanisms couple sensory and metabolic pathways while
	neuromodulatory pathways influence both metabolic and food seeking/consumption
	pathways. The shared ancestry of C. elegans and mammalian fat regulatory
	pathways extends to developmental programs that underlie fat storage
	capacity, despite lack of dedicated adipocytes, and genes whose human
	homologs are implicated in obesity. This suggests that many of the
	newly identified C. elegans fat regulatory pathways play similar
	roles in mammals. C. elegans is ideally suited for the integrated
	study of mechanisms that operate in multiple tissues and elicit feedback
	responses that affect processes as diverse as metabolism and behavior.},

@article{Deuring2011,
	Abstract = {The intestinal tract is covered by a total of 300 square metres of
	IECs (intestinal epithelial cells) that covers the entire intestinal
	mucosa. For protection against luminal xenobiotics, pathogens and
	commensal microbes, these IECs are equipped with membrane-bound transporters
	as well as the ability to secrete specific protective proteins. In
	patients with active IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), the expression
	of these proteins, e.g. ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters such
	as ABCG2 (ABC transporter G2) and defensins, is decreased, thereby
	limiting the protection against various luminal threats. Correct
	ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-dependent protein folding is essential
	for the localization and function of secreted and membrane-bound
	proteins. Inflammatory triggers, such as cytokines and nitric oxide,
	can impede protein folding, which causes the accumulation of unfolded
	proteins inside the ER. As a result, the unfolded protein response
	is activated which can lead to a cellular process named ER stress.
	The protein folding impairment affects the function and localization
	of several proteins, including those involved in protection against
	xenobiotics. In the present review, we discuss the possible inflammatory
	pathways affecting protein folding and eventually leading to IEC
	malfunction in patients with active IBD.},

@article{cogs,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome
	sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and
	the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification
	of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on
	orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework
	for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation
	of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. RESULTS: We describe
	here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation
	of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced
	genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction
	of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which
	we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The COG collection
	currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and
	comprise 75% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes
	of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs)
	include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode
	Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and
	Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular
	microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG
	set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838
	proteins, or approximately 54% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655
	gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes
	with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could
	be included into the KOGs; addition of new eukaryotic genomes is
	expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic
	genomes with KOGs. Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals
	a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting
	of approximately 20% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the
	KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set
	(approximately 1% of the COGs). In part, this difference is probably
	due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could
	also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and
	the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. CONCLUSION:
	The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes
	and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional
	annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex
	eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

@article{seed,
	Abstract = {The release of the 1000th complete microbial genome will occur in
	the next two to three years. In anticipation of this milestone, the
	Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) launched the Project
	to Annotate 1000 Genomes. The project is built around the principle
	that the key to improved accuracy in high-throughput annotation technology
	is to have experts annotate single subsystems over the complete collection
	of genomes, rather than having an annotation expert attempt to annotate
	all of the genes in a single genome. Using the subsystems approach,
	all of the genes implementing the subsystem are analyzed by an expert
	in that subsystem. An annotation environment was created where populated
	subsystems are curated and projected to new genomes. A portable notion
	of a populated subsystem was defined, and tools developed for exchanging
	and curating these objects. Tools were also developed to resolve
	conflicts between populated subsystems. The SEED is the first annotation
	environment that supports this model of annotation. Here, we describe
	the subsystem approach, and offer the first release of our growing
	library of populated subsystems. The initial release of data includes
	180 177 distinct proteins with 2133 distinct functional roles. This
	data comes from 173 subsystems and 383 different organisms.},

@article{tigrfam,
	Abstract = {TIGRFAMs, available online at http://www.jcvi.org/tigrfams is a database
	of protein family definitions. Each entry features a seed alignment
	of trusted representative sequences, a hidden Markov model (HMM)
	built from that alignment, cutoff scores that let automated annotation
	pipelines decide which proteins are members, and annotations for
	transfer onto member proteins. Most TIGRFAMs models are designated
	equivalog, meaning they assign a specific name to proteins conserved
	in function from a common ancestral sequence. Models describing more
	functionally heterogeneous families are designated subfamily or domain,
	and assign less specific but more widely applicable annotations.
	The Genome Properties database, available at http://www.jcvi.org/genome-properties,
	specifies how computed evidence, including TIGRFAMs HMM results,
	should be used to judge whether an enzymatic pathway, a protein complex
	or another type of molecular subsystem is encoded in a genome. TIGRFAMs
	and Genome Properties content are developed in concert because subsystems
	reconstruction for large numbers of genomes guides selection of seed
	alignment sequences and cutoff values during protein family construction.
	Both databases specialize heavily in bacterial and archaeal subsystems.
	At present, 4284 models appear in TIGRFAMs, while 628 systems are
	described by Genome Properties. Content derives both from subsystem
	discovery work and from biocuration of the scientific literature.},

	Abstract = {To understand the impact of gut microbes on human health and well-being
	it is crucial to assess their genetic potential. Here we describe
	the Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, assembly and characterization
	of 3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes, derived from 576.7
	gigabases of sequence, from faecal samples of 124 European individuals.
	The gene set, approximately 150 times larger than the human gene
	complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more
	frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably includes a large
	proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The
	genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99%
	of the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire cohort harbours
	between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual
	at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared. We define
	and describe the minimal gut metagenome and the minimal gut bacterial
	genome in terms of functions present in all individuals and most
	bacteria, respectively.},

	Abstract = {We show that parametric multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems with large state and action spaces can be algorithmically reduced to the supervised learning model known as ``Knows What It Knows'' or KWIK learning. We give matching impossibility results showing that the KWIK-learnability requirement can- not be replaced by weaker supervised learn- ing assumptions. We provide such results in both the standard parametric MAB setting, as well as for a new model in which the action space is finite but growing with time.},

	Abstract = {Many real-world classification tasks involve the prediction of multiple,
	inter-dependent class labels. A prototypical case of this sort deals
	with prediction of a sequence of labels for a sequence of observations.
	Such problems arise naturally in the context of annotating and segmenting
	observation sequences. This paper generalizes Gaussian Process classification
	to predict multiple labels by taking dependencies between neighboring
	labels into account. Our approach is motivated by the desire to retain
	rigorous probabilistic semantics, while overcoming limitations of
	parametric methods like Conditional Random Fields, which exhibit
	conceptual and computational difficulties in high-dimensional input
	spaces. Experiments on named entity recognition and pitch accent
	prediction tasks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach.},

	Review = {HMMs are widely used in sequence prediction as a means of predicting the movement between states (ACTG). While other approaches like Adaboost, perceptrons and SVMs have been suggested, this paper presents the use of Gaussian processes to learning the sequence by applying SVMs and conditional random fields (CRF). This method combines the advantages of the rigorous probabilistic semantics of CRFs and overcomes the curse of dimensionality problem using kernels in order to construct and learn over RKHS.},

	Abstract = {The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) provides researchers with quality-controlled
	bacterial and archaeal small subunit rRNA alignments and analysis
	tools. An improved alignment strategy uses the Infernal secondary
	structure aware aligner to provide a more consistent higher quality
	alignment and faster processing of user sequences. Substantial new
	analysis features include a new Pyrosequencing Pipeline that provides
	tools to support analysis of ultra high-throughput rRNA sequencing
	data. This pipeline offers a collection of tools that automate the
	data processing and simplify the computationally intensive analysis
	of large sequencing libraries. In addition, a new Taxomatic visualization
	tool allows rapid visualization of taxonomic inconsistencies and
	suggests corrections, and a new class Assignment Generator provides
	instructors with a lesson plan and individualized teaching materials.
	Details about RDP data and analytical functions can be found at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},

	Abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of environmental samples. Because few tools
	exist for metagenomic analysis, a natural step has been to utilize
	the popular homology tool, BLAST, to search for sequence similarity
	between sample fragments and an administered database. Most biologists
	use this method today without knowing BLASTs accuracy, especially
	when a particular taxonomic class is underrepresented in the database.
	The aim of this paper is to benchmark the performance of BLAST for
	taxonomic classification of metagenomic datasets in a supervised
	setting; meaning that the database contains microbes of the same
	class as theunknown query fragments. We examine well- and under-represented
	genera and phyla in order to study their effect on the accuracy of
	BLAST. We conclude that on fine-resolution classes, such as genera,
	the accuracy of BLAST does not degrade very much with underrepresentation,
	but in a highly variant class, such as phyla, performance degrades
	significantly. Our analysis includes five-fold cross validation to
	substantiate our findings.},

	Review = {CONCLUSION: Our analysis has shown that database composition contributes substantially to the accuracy of the BLAST algorithm. Overall weve found that the standard deviation of percent accuracy scores decreases with increasing class representation in the database. Weve also demonstrated that BLAST performs much better than chance even when representation in the database is much smaller than the majority as shown in the phyla experiments. However, when BLAST misclassifies a fragment, it appears to assign the fragment by chance.},

Observations (Gradient) --increasing the number of sequences per sample does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the ability to detect ecological patterns --simulated subtle gradients were revealed at greater numbers of sequences per sample suggesting that investigation of more subtle effects requires deeper sequencing. --Qualitative methods (either the species was there or it was not) generally performed worse than quantitative (abundance-weighted) methods Generating Clusters --partitioned samples into discrete clusters. To simulate this, we formed a hypothetical sample at the root of a hierarchy, which defined the relatedness of samples both inter- and intra-cluster --communities were clustered into discrete communities. Observations (Clustering) --relative efficacy of different analyses was dependent on the relatedness of clusters and that different analysis techniques applied to the same data were of substantially different effectiveness at revealing the underlying clusters --some measures that work well on gradient data, fail to accuractely identify the distinct clusters --the recommended analysis methodology depended on the degree of separation between the underlying clusters, and that even excessive sequencing did not provide reasonable resolution if we chose the wrong analytical method Cluster Quality: fraction of sample pairs that are correctly identified as belonging to the same or different clusters Questions --why does the keyboard dataset produce three distinct clusters? what do these clusters represent? --why implement pco with different distance measures? pca works off the covariance matrix Future: --Resolving the arch effect so that multiple gradients can be studied remains an important challenge for the field.},

@article{Pan2010TKDE,
	Abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms
	is that the training and future data must be in the
	
	same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many
	real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For
	
	example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of
	interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain
	
	of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space
	or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge
	
	transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance
	of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In
	
	recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework
	to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing
	
	and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification,
	regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we
	
	discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related
	machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask
	
	learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We
	also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning
	
	research.},

	ecology remains a significant
	
	challenge. To deduce important ecological indicators such as environmental
	adaptation, molecular
	
	trait dispersal, diversity variation and primary production from the
	gene pool of an ecosystem, we
	
	integrated 25 ocean metagenomes with geographical, meteorological
	and geophysicochemical data.
	
	We find that climatic factors (temperature, sunlight) are the major
	determinants of the biomolecular
	
	repertoire of each sample and the main limiting factor on functional
	trait dispersal (absence of
	
	biogeographic provincialism). Molecular functional richness and diversity
	show a distinct
	
	latitudinal gradient peaking at 201N and correlate with primary production.
	The latter can also be
	
	predicted from the molecular functional composition of an environmental
	sample. Together, our
	
	results show that the functional community composition derived from
	metagenomes is an important
	
	quantitative readout for molecular trait-based biogeography and ecology.},

	methods from machine learning, including some that are novel, and

	are not closely related, the use of domain adaptation methods can
	help improve classification performance.},

	Review = {Notes: In the sense of a domain adaptation problem in computational biology, P(X) may or may not vary while P_S(Y|X) != P_T(Y|X). Here, two organisms may have evolved from a common ancestor and a certain biological function may have changed due to evolutionary pressures. This is unlike classical covariate shift where P_T(X) != P_S(X) and P_S(Y|X) = P_T(Y|X). For a given feature vector x the label y is thus independent of the domain from which the example stems. The study focus on classifying splice sites of C. elegans (source) and apply the classifier C. remanei (target) which divereged from C. elegans 100 million years ago. The authors compare SVMs trained on source on;y, target only, a convex combination of source+target, a weighted combination of source+ target (primal optimization problem), dual tasking learning, kernel mean matching, feature augmentation, and combinations of multiple sources. From our observations we can conclude that the simple convex combination approach works surprisingly well. It is only outperformed by the dual-task learning algorithm which performs consistently well for all organisms and target training set sizes.},

@article{Sharpton2011CB,
	Abstract = {Microbial diversity is typically characterized by clustering ribosomal
	RNA (SSU-rRNA) sequences into operational taxonomic
	
	units (OTUs). Targeted sequencing of environmental SSU-rRNA markers
	via PCR may fail to detect OTUs due to biases in
	
	priming and amplification. Analysis of shotgun sequenced environmental
	DNA, known as metagenomics, avoids
	
	amplification bias but generates fragmentary, non-overlapping sequence
	reads that cannot be clustered by existing OTUfinding
	
	methods. To circumvent these limitations, we developed PhylOTU, a
	computational workflow that identifies OTUs
	
	from metagenomic SSU-rRNA sequence data through the use of phylogenetic
	principles and probabilistic sequence profiles.
	
	Using simulated metagenomic data, we quantified the accuracy with
	which PhylOTU clusters reads into OTUs. Comparisons
	
	of PCR and shotgun sequenced SSU-rRNA markers derived from the global
	open ocean revealed that while PCR libraries
	
	identify more OTUs per sequenced residue, metagenomic libraries recover
	a greater taxonomic diversity of OTUs. In
	
	addition, we discover novel species, genera and families in the metagenomic
	libraries, including OTUs from phyla missed by
	
	analysis of PCR sequences. Taken together, these results suggest that
	PhylOTU enables characterization of part of the
	
	biosphere currently hidden from PCR-based surveys of diversity?},

	Abstract = {Background: Molecular studies of microbial diversity have provided
	many insights into the bacterial communities
	
	inhabiting the human body and the environment. A common first step
	in such studies is a survey of conserved
	
	marker genes (primarily 16S rRNA) to characterize the taxonomic composition
	and diversity of these communities.
	
	To date, however, there exists significant variability in analysis
	methods employed in these studies.
	
	
	Results: Here we provide a critical assessment of current analysis
	methodologies that cluster sequences into
	
	operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and demonstrate that small changes
	in algorithm parameters can lead to
	
	significantly varying results. Our analysis provides strong evidence
	that the species-level diversity estimates
	
	produced using common OTU methodologies are inflated due to overly
	stringent parameter choices. We further
	
	describe an example of how semi-supervised clustering can produce
	OTUs that are more robust to changes in
	
	algorithm parameters.
	
	
	Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for systematic and open
	evaluation of data analysis methodologies,
	
	especially as targeted 16S rRNA diversity studies are increasingly
	relying on high-throughput sequencing
	
	technologies. All data and results from our study are available through
	the JGI FAMeS website http://fames.jgi-psf.

@article{Wooley2010CBio,
	Abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the
	
	genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster,
	
	cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to
	
	sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from
	
	their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of
	
	the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information
	
	from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a
	
	serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured mi-
	
	crobes, the genomic data come from a single clone,
	
	making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In
	
	metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous
	
	microbial communities, sometimes containing more than
	
	10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and
	
	partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and
	
	function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in
	
	interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial se-
	
	quence data. Although metagenomics is a relative
	
	newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an
	
	explosion in computational methods applied to metage-
	
	nomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope
	
	of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we
	
	provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to
	
	the current computational requirements presented by
	
	metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We
	
	also note whether there is software that implements any
	
	of the methods presented here, and briefly review its
	
	utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this
	
	article would avail themselves of the comment section
	
	provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences.
	
	Finally, the last section of this article provides a few
	
	representative studies illustrating different facets of recent
	
	scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},
